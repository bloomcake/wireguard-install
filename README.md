In this version of the script you can choose the private WireGuard network (https://github.com/bloomcake/wireguard-install/commit/4b5e629b5dba58ce8da761ff1ca88d150f93b0a7) yourself.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/J6X4R -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall WireGuard.
